https://github.com/a5ura/AUTONOMOUS-WHEELCHAIR/assets/120297115/d1b35fba-a278-4674-8a67-babdbc4c65a1



Background:-
{
Current Wheelchair Limitations
    Traditional Models: Predominantly manual or joystick-controlled wheelchairs in use.
    User Dependency: High dependency on caregivers for mobility assistance, limiting independence.

Potential of Machine Vision Technology
    Autonomous Navigation: Employing advanced cameras and computer vision algorithms for self-guided navigation.
    Cross-Field Applications: Demonstrated success of machine vision in areas like autonomous vehicles, robotics, and smart surveillance.
}


Objective:-
{
Aim 1: Wheelchair Modification
      Innovative Retrofitting: Transforming a standard mechanical wheelchair by integrating
      it with hoverboard hub motors for enhanced mobility and control.
      Enhanced Dynamics: Upgrading the wheelchair's movement capabilities for more 
      responsive and smoother navigation.

Aim 2: Machine Vision Integration
      Camera Attachment: Equipping the wheelchair with a high-resolution camera to serve as the 'eyes' of the system.

Aim 3: April Tag Detection and Following
       Target Recognition: Developing software to accurately identify and track individuals wearing April tags.
       Responsive Movement: Programming the wheelchair to autonomously follow the tracked individual, adjusting its speed and direction based on their movement.
