Process Overview : SOFTWARE

Step-1: Camera Calibration
Determine camera parameters to ensure accurate vision processing.

Step-2: April Tag Detection
Implement an algorithm to recognize and track April Tags.

Step-3: April Tag Distance Measurement
Calculate the distance between the camera and the April Tag for proximity control.

Step-4: April Tag Direction/Position Detection
Detect the direction and position of the April Tag relative to the camera.

Step-5: Arduino Python Interface
Develop a communication interface between Python scripts and the Arduino.

Step-6: Initialize Arduino
Set up the Arduino with the necessary configurations for operation.

Step-7: Sending Data to Arduino from Python
Transmit control signals from the laptop(python) to Arduino, directing wheelchair movement.
